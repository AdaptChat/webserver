              Positions are scoped per category, and categories have their own positions. Channels that
              lack a category will be shown above all categories. This is because no channels can be
              displayed in between or after categories - in the UI all non-category channels are displayed
              above any other category channels.

              For example:

              ```text
              [0] text-channel
              [1] voice-channel
              [2] another-text-channel
